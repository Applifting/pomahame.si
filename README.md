# pomuzeme.si

An open-source platform which aims to simplify and streamline the coordination of volunteers. Through the platform, local organizations can reach volunteers in the area where assistance is needed. This project originated as a voluntary initiative in connection with the COVID-19 infection.

## Getting Started

The application is an MVC monolith written in the RubyOnRails framework. On Frontend we are using common "bootstrap" based frameworks such as Bulma or Materialize design.

### Local development environment

#### Required software

1. Ruby 2.6.3
2. NodeJS
3. yarn (`sudo npm install -g yarn`)
4. PostgreSQL
5. Redis

#### Steps to get it running

1. `git@github.com:Applifting/pomuzeme.si.git && pomuzeme.si`
2. `bundle install`
3. `rake db:create && rake db:migrate` Note: avoid `db:setup` as there is an `db:create` hook that is required,
   in order to have postgres extension.
4. `yarn install`
5. `rails server`

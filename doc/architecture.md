Architecture
------------
Pomuzeme.si - consists of two modules - landing page and administration interface

Following decisions were made
- [Devise](https://github.com/heartcombo/devise) authentication gem with strong password check. But please no unicorns.
    - For email templates override deviceâ€™s I18n locales to personalize translations
- [CanCanCan](https://github.com/CanCanCommunity/cancancan) authorization. Make two or three roles (admin, superadmin, coordinator)
- [Rolify](https://github.com/RolifyCommunity/rolify) - user roles management
- [Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) as activejob backend
- [ActiveAdmin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) for scaffolding controllers
- Postgres with postgis extension. Use [activerecord-postgis-adapter](https://github.com/rgeo/activerecord-postgis-adapter)
- Google geolocation api - need to find appropriate gem, maybe [geocoder](https://github.com/alexreisner/geocoder)
